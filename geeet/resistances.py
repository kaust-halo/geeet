    Calculate the original TSEB resistances from Norman et al., 1995 (N95) 
    
    Inputs:
        - U: wind speed in m/s, numpy array or an ee.Image
        - CH: canopy height in m, numpy array or ee.Image 
             (originally "hc" in N95, renamed CH here so that it is
             not confused with sensible heat flux)
        - rough_params: zm, zh, and d0, either as a list [] of numpy arrays,
                        or ee.Image (see geeet.meteo.compute_roughness) with three bands:
                        zm: roughness length for momentum transport (m)
                        zh: roughness length for heat transport     (m)
                        d0: zero-plane displacement height          (m)
        - LAI: leaf area index (m2/m2)  (originally "F" in N95). Numpy array or ee.Image
        Scalar inputs:
        - leaf_width: mean (or "effective") leaf width (m) 
                     (Goudriaan 1977; see equation B.3 in N95)
        - z_u: measurement height (m) for wind speed
        - z_t: measurement height (m) for temperature
        Optional:
        - L: Monin-Obukhov length (see geeet.MOST), defaults to a large value (neutral conditions)
        - Ustar: If Ustar is given, it is used in the calculation for RA. By default we use
                the explicit parameterization of N95 equation 6. 
        - rough_bands: (list) if rough_params is an ee.Image, rough_bands specifies the names
                       given to the roughness length for momentum, roughness length for
                       heat, and zero-plane displacement height, respectively. 
                       Defaults to the default values in geeet.resistances.compute_roughness,
                       i.e., 'ZM', 'ZH', and 'D0'
        - band_names: if calculating resistances as ee.Images and
                      band_names are given as a list of strings,
                      the bands are renamed before returning the output. 
                     
    Outputs (see diagrams below):
        - resistances: either a list of numpy arrays, or ee.Image with the following elements:
            - Ra: numpy array, or ee.Image with band name set to band_names[0]
            - Rs: numpy array, or ee.Image with band name set to band_names[1]
            - Rx: numpy array, or ee.Image with band name set to band_names[2]

        Hc+Hs = H ~ (Tac-Tair)/Ra      |     H ~ sum of above 2 terms
    (to transform ~ into =, scale by rho*Cp)

    Ra and Rs are both caculated equally for both networks.

    The parallel network allows a simpler computation and is ok for 
    sparse, clumped vegetation common to semi-arid regions*
    i.e. where canopy and soil interact less with each other

    Rx considers a "coupling" of the canopy/soil fluxes 

    *For irrigated agriculture with dense vegetation, e.g.
    center-pivots, the in-series network might be more appropriate. 

    Ra  is the aerodynamic resistance calculated from the diabatically corrected
        log temperature profile equations (Brutsaert, 1982)
        Ra = (0.16U)^-1  * [ln((zu-d)/zm) - psiM] * [ln((zt-d)/zm) - psiH]  (Equation 6)
            where zu, zt are measurement height of wind speed and temperature
            d~0.65*hc   (hc is canopy height)  displacement height
            zm~hc/8                            roughness length for momentum
    
    Rs  is the resistance to transport of heat between the soil surfce and a height
        representing the canopy.
        Rs = 1 / (a1 + b1 Us)   (Equation B1)
            where a1~0.004 ms-1; b1~0.012,
            Us is the wind speed at the soil surface (where the effect of the soil surface
            roughness is minimal) at about 0.05 m to 0.2 m
            and is related to the wind speed at the top of the canopy (Uc) (Equations B2 - B4)

    Rx  is unique to the in-series network (doesn't appear in the in-parallel)
        defined as the total boundary layer resistance of the complete canopy 
        of leaves
        Rx = (C1/LAI)(s/Udzm)^1/2  (Equation A.8)
        where C1 ~ 90 s-1/2 m-1
        s is the average leaf width
        Udzm is given by equation A.9 and is obtained after computing Uc (Equations B2-B4)
